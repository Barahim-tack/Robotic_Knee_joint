# Robotic_Knee_joint
A simple design of robotic knee joint using SolidWorks

This file explain a simple design of robotic knee joint using SolidWorks. The design contains: 
1. Part one (upper joint)
2. Part two (lower joint)
3. Bearing (10 mm bore)
4. Pin 

The simulation for testing the joint was done using SolidWorks simulation based on a load of 50 Kg, assuming that the upper section of the robot has a weight of 100 kg. The simulation results show that this design is safe to use under this situation.
